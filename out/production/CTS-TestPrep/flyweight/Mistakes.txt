Flyweight

There is no clear distinction between temporary and permanent data

Flyweight objects do not manage the permanent state.

There are no specific Flyweight methods that receive the temporary state and process it along with the permanent state.

The Flyweight object also manages the temporary state (stores the value by its attributes)

The Flyweight object Factory is not implemented correctly. For example, it generates a new Flyweight object each time and does not reuse it.
